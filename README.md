# Seattle_Airbnb

# Motivation
This project aims to analyze the vacancy rate of the properties on Seattle's Airbnb market. This will provide some insights to the potential investors by answering the critical questions such as which neighborhoods in Seattle are worth investing, what types of property are favored by the Airbnb customers and whether owner's policies like cancellation policy and minimum nights will affect the property's vacancy rate.

# Files
The Seattle Airbnb dataset is from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data). The dataset contains Seattle Airbnb rentals listed from 2016-01-04 to 2017-01-02. It includes two tables _calendar.csv_ and _listings.csv_. _calendar.csv_ has the availability data for each rental listing for 365 days. _listings.csv_ has detailed information for each rental listing. 

All data analysis is done in Seattle_AirBnB.ipynb(https://github.com/cr8zysheila/Seattle_Airbnb/blob/master/Seattle_AirBnB.ipynb) in this repository. The two tables (calendar.csv and listings.csv) in the dataset are in the same repository.

# Summary of the results
If you want to buy a property in Seattle for your Airbnb business, the Cascade area is your best bet. You may want to consider condo or townhouse first, since they have much lower vacancy rate. Renting out the entire property also help lower vacancy rate. As to Cancellation Policy, just choose whatever makes you comfortable. At last, when setting the minimum nights of stay, try making it longer if it's shorter than 6 nights.
