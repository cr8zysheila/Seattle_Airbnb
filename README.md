# Seattle_Airbnb

This project aims to analyze the vacancy rate of the properties on Seattle's Airbnb market. This will provide some insights to the potential investors by answering the critical questions such as which neighborhoods in Seattle are worth investing, what types of property are favored by the Airbnb customers and whether owner's policies like cancellation policy and minimum nights will affect the property's vacancy rate.

The Seattle Airbnb dataset is from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data). The dataset contains Seattle Airbnb rentals listed from 2016-01-04 to 2017-01-02. It includes two tables _calendar.csv_ and _listings.csv_. _calendar.csv_ has the availability data for each rental listing for 365 days. _listings.csv_ has detailed information for each rental listing. 

All data analysis is done in Seattle_AirBnB.ipynb(https://github.com/cr8zysheila/Seattle_Airbnb/blob/master/Seattle_AirBnB.ipynb) in this repository. The two tables (calendar.csv and listings.csv) in the dataset are in the same repository. 

To run the notebook Seattle_AirBnB.ipynb, the following Python packages are needed:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
