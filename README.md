# Seattle_Airbnb

This project aims to analyze the vacancy rate of the properties on Seattle's Airbnb market. This will provide some insights to the potential investors by answering the critical questions such as which neighborhoods in Seattle are worth investing, what types of property are favored by the Airbnb customers and whether owner's policies like cancellation policy and minimum nights will affect the property's vacancy rate.

All data analysis is done in Seattle_AirBnB.ipynb. The two tables (calendar.csv and listings.csv) in the dataset are in the same repository. 

To run the notebook, the following Python packages are needed:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
